groups and they seem to be taking our idea of screening candidates
to a next level. Not only they ask candidates to provide resume and
cover letter + some project related information but also request
written answers to questions like "Why are you interested in this
position" etc. That allows to screen out people who just submit
multiple resumes to multiple organizations without really applying
for that particular job and it would make our interview process more
straightforward, knowing answers to some questions.

For example, we may want to always include in the screening
questions:
- Why do you want to work for Freeform Solutions?
- Why are you interested in this position?
- What's your experience working with NFP?
- What's your experience working with Open Source software?
etc.

I also saw that people ask for references up front, in that
submissions form. We could include the HR requirement that Heather
brought recently for "permissions to ask your references about you"
in the online form so that we don't have to follow up with this
later.

Attached below a sample of such screening questions]]></note></topic><topic position="1614,-728" order="1" text="Strategy integrated with hiring plan" id="299"><note><![CDATA[Hiring plan should be comprehensive... not Agile or Iterative, in the sense that staff capacity and skill needs should be met within at least a six month plan.
