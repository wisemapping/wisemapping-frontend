      <span>Another way of asking this question is can you sum up in a sentence what the main point is that your essay is making?) If you <i>don't </i>have a main claim (or don't know what your main claim is!), then your essay <i>will not </i>get a good mark. You are assessed on the quality of the argument you put forward for your main claim, and in order to be able to do this we (and you) need to know what your main claim is.</span>

      <span>It is not enough e.g. to <i>say </i>that “I will be looking at arguments on both sides of this issue and coming to a conclusion”. You should tell us <i>which </i>arguments you will be looking at, <i>what</i>your evaluation of each of these arguments will be, and <i>how</i>this analysis justifies the overall main claim you will be making. There are two reasons to give an overview of the structure of your argument: (a) it makes it much easier for the reader to grasp what you are saying, and why; (b) writing a summary of the structure of your argument is a good way of testing that <i>you do in fact </i>have a coherent argument. </span>
